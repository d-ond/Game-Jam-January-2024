# Current idea for theme
- Nature overtaking metal, we are either clearing or adding to nature
- Goal is to either spread further or to combo a section to clear

## To do:
- GDD draft
- Refine ideas

## Current mechanics being tested:
- Combo/matching game systems

Current progress here is decent, creating a Tetris-like system of a grid. This can be extended to a different system

- dodging hazards

Similar to top-down shooters and dodging bullets, but in this case it comes from the top of the screen

- avoiding being pulled in

Same as above, thinking of the final boss in Shovel Knight Showdown because that's the most recent thing on the brain. There's also the target mini-game -> line them up and clear in one go

- wall bounces

Easy to implement, but trickiness comes from determining which grid coordinate to end the movement

- grid data structure

implemented via Tetris clone, but in that case it is the entire game. How does it work with a character that can move and shoot?
